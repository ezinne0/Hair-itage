        <div class="history-paragraph"><p>In many African societies, hair was a sacred cultural and spiritual symbol. Braids and other intricate hairstyles were often worn to signify marital status, age, religion, wealth, and rank in society. In some cultures, a person’s surname could be ascertained simply by the hairstyle they had. Even things used to adorn the hair of African people, like beaded braids and special headdresses were part of the unique essence of Black hair. These adornments were typically reserved for royalty or those of higher rank within the society. Seeing as the head is the highest part of the body, many cultures believed hair connected them with the divine (gods and spirits). Intricate braided style could take hours, even days, thus, hair styling was a social ritual many families and friends bonded through. This rite of passage still exists today, as many Black people relate to the laughter and stories that are shared when getting their hair done.

          <div class="history-paragraph"><p>The creation of chattel slavery given the transatlantic slave trade was the turning point for the perception of Black hair, and is what gives the topic it’s difficult complexity. One of the first things slave traders did to their new cargo was shave their heads. Interpretations include that this was done for sanitary reasons, as hair could become a hassle to take care of when transporting enslaved people. However, the effect of this was far more impactful and insidious. Shaving the heads of the African people they attempted to take away centuries of culture that had existed before their arrival. Eenslaved people became anonymous chattel, not differentiated by their unique hairstyles. This is particularly dehumanizing because it was clearly intended to strip away the African people's connection to their culture through their hair. When their hair grew back, they no longer had access to the same herbal treatments, oils, and combs from their homeland. Nevertheless, they got creative, using bacon grease, butter, and kerosene as conditioners, cornmeal and dry shampoo, and sheep fleece carding tools as combs.</p></div>
          <div class="history-paragraph"><p>Once the transatlantic slave trade had taken off, enslaved women began to cover their hair in rags, given the lack of agency or free time they had to take care of their bodies. Not only were the bodies of enslaved Black women treated as objects and exploited for pleasure by their enslavers, but even their hair suffered from the grip of white supremacy.  In this era, braiding no longer took place in the form of intricate designs, because they didn’t have the proper tools, and lacked the time needed. However, enslaved people used the simple braids to hide rice or seeds in their hair before a long journey.</p></div>
